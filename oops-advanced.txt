### **ðŸš€ How to Approach LLD Questions?**
1. **Understand Requirements** â†’ Ask clarifying questions  
2. **Identify Entities** â†’ Define classes and relationships  
3. **Apply SOLID Principles** â†’ Keep the design flexible and scalable  
4. **Use Design Patterns** â†’ Factory, Singleton, Observer, etc.  
5. **Optimize for Scalability** â†’ Consider databases, caching, and API design
