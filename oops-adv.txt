Great! Let's dive into some more challenging topics. Below are a few advanced **OOP** and **JavaScript** interview-level exercises that test your understanding of key concepts such as inheritance, polymorphism, design patterns, and more.

### **1. Design a Library System (Real-world Design)**

**Problem:**
You need to design a library system that can manage different types of books, users, and loaning operations. The system should allow:
- Users to borrow and return books.
- Track overdue books.
- Different types of books (e.g., regular books, e-books).
- Use inheritance to handle the shared properties of books.

**Requirements:**
- Base class `Book` with attributes like `title`, `author`, `ISBN`.
- Subclasses `EBook` and `PrintedBook` to represent different types of books.
- Base class `User` with methods to borrow and return books.
- Subclass `PremiumUser` (inherits from `User`) with additional privileges like borrowing more books.

**Task:**
- Design the classes with proper attributes and methods.
- Use **Polymorphism** for different types of books.
- Handle overdue books.

### **2. Implement a Cache System (LRU Cache)**

**Problem:**
Implement an **LRU (Least Recently Used)** cache system using classes. It should allow:
- Storing key-value pairs.
- Automatically removing the least recently used item when the cache exceeds its capacity.

**Requirements:**
- The cache should have a maximum size.
- Implement two main operations: `set(key, value)` and `get(key)`.
- When the cache exceeds its capacity, remove the least recently used key-value pair.

**Task:**
- Implement the `LRUCache` class with a **Doubly Linked List** and **Hash Map** for efficient storage and access.

### **3. Observer Pattern: Event Dispatcher**

**Problem:**
Create a simple **Event Dispatcher** system where different components of the system can subscribe to events, and when those events occur, the dispatcher notifies all the subscribers.

**Requirements:**
- An `EventDispatcher` class that manages subscriptions and event triggering.
- The dispatcher should allow multiple subscribers for the same event and notify all of them when the event is triggered.
- Implement an example where different subscribers are notified when an event occurs.

**Task:**
- Create an `EventDispatcher` class that supports adding subscribers and triggering events.
- Demonstrate the use of this class by setting up multiple subscribers.

### **4. Implement a Bank Transaction System (Transaction History)**

**Problem:**
Design a system to track bank account transactions. Every transaction should be logged in a transaction history and should have an amount, type (deposit/withdrawal), and timestamp.

**Requirements:**
- A `Transaction` class with attributes `amount`, `type`, and `timestamp`.
- A `BankAccount` class to handle deposits, withdrawals, and track transaction history.
- The `BankAccount` class should implement the **Strategy Pattern** to support different transaction types (e.g., normal transactions, fraud prevention).

**Task:**
- Create the classes and implement methods to deposit, withdraw, and maintain transaction history.
- Use the **Strategy Pattern** to define different transaction behaviors.

---

### **5. Implement a Task Scheduler with Priorities**

**Problem:**
You need to implement a task scheduler where each task has a priority and a scheduled time. Tasks with higher priority should be executed before lower priority tasks, and tasks should be executed at their scheduled time.

**Requirements:**
- A `Task` class with `name`, `priority`, and `time`.
- A `TaskScheduler` class that schedules tasks based on priority and time.
- Use a **Min-Heap** or **Priority Queue** to manage tasks efficiently.

**Task:**
- Implement a task scheduler that prioritizes tasks and executes them in order.
- Ensure the scheduler can handle multiple tasks with the same priority.

---

### **6. Implement a Custom Iterator (Iterator Pattern)**

**Problem:**
Design a custom **Iterator Pattern** for a collection of data. You should be able to iterate over a collection and provide additional functionality like filtering or transforming the data.

**Requirements:**
- A `Collection` class that holds an array of items.
- An `Iterator` class that iterates over the collection.
- Implement the **Iterator Pattern** with functionality like filtering and mapping the data during iteration.

**Task:**
- Design the `Collection` and `Iterator` classes, and implement filtering and transformation during iteration.

---

### **7. Implement a Singleton Pattern**

**Problem:**
Implement the **Singleton Pattern** in JavaScript. The Singleton should ensure that only one instance of the class exists, and it provides a global point of access.

**Requirements:**
- A class `DatabaseConnection` should only have one instance.
- Implement the **Singleton Pattern** to ensure only one instance of the class is created.
- Provide a method to access the instance.

**Task:**
- Create a `DatabaseConnection` class that implements the **Singleton Pattern**.

---

### **8. Design a Notification System**

**Problem:**
Design a notification system where different types of notifications can be sent (e.g., Email, SMS, Push Notification). The system should allow users to subscribe to different notification channels and trigger notifications.

**Requirements:**
- A `Notification` base class with methods for sending notifications.
- Subclasses `EmailNotification`, `SMSNotification`, and `PushNotification`.
- A `User` class that can subscribe to specific notification channels.
- Use the **Observer Pattern** to notify users when a new notification is triggered.

**Task:**
- Implement the classes and methods to send notifications and allow users to subscribe to different channels.

---

### **9. Implement a Binary Search Tree (BST)**

**Problem:**
Design and implement a **Binary Search Tree (BST)** with the following operations:
- **insert(value)**: Insert a new value into the tree.
- **delete(value)**: Delete a value from the tree.
- **search(value)**: Search for a value in the tree.
- **in-order traversal**: Print the tree in in-order (sorted) order.

**Requirements:**
- Create a `Node` class with `left`, `right`, and `value` attributes.
- Create a `BinarySearchTree` class with methods for insertion, deletion, searching, and traversal.

**Task:**
- Implement the BST and demonstrate its functionality.

### **10. Design a Movie Booking System**

**Problem:**
Design a movie booking system where users can:
- View available movies.
- Book tickets.
- Check availability of a particular movie or theater.

**Requirements:**
- A `Movie` class with `title`, `director`, `duration`.
- A `Theater` class that has multiple `Movie` objects and seats.
- A `User` class with methods for booking tickets.

**Task:**
- Implement the system using proper class design and relationships between `Movie`, `Theater`, and `User`.

---

### **How to Approach These Problems:**
- Break the problem down into smaller components.
- Think about the relationships between classes (e.g., inheritance, composition).
- Use design patterns (e.g., **Singleton**, **Factory**, **Observer**, **Strategy**) where appropriate.
- Focus on **code readability**, **maintainability**, and **efficiency**.
