Since you've just learned OOP basics, you can solve several **Low-Level Design (LLD) problems** using fundamental OOP concepts like **Encapsulation, Abstraction, Inheritance, and Polymorphism**. Here are some problems that only require OOP basics:

### ðŸ”¹ **1. Design a Parking Lot System**  
**Concepts Used:** Classes, Objects, Encapsulation, Inheritance  

ðŸ‘‰ **Problem:**  
Design a parking lot system that supports different vehicle types (car, bike, truck), parking spots, and basic operations like parking and leaving a vehicle.  

ðŸ’¡ **OOP Breakdown:**  
- `Vehicle` class (base class with subclasses: `Car`, `Bike`, `Truck`)  
- `ParkingSpot` class (small, medium, large spots)  
- `ParkingLot` class (handles available spots, assigns vehicles)

### ðŸ”¹ **2. Design a Library Management System**  
**Concepts Used:** Classes, Objects, Encapsulation  

ðŸ‘‰ **Problem:**  
Build a system to manage books, users, and borrowing transactions.  

ðŸ’¡ **OOP Breakdown:**  
- `Book` class (title, author, ISBN, availability)  
- `User` class (name, ID, borrowed books)  
- `Library` class (manages books, borrowing, returning)

### ðŸ”¹ **3. Design an ATM Machine**  
**Concepts Used:** Classes, Objects, Encapsulation  

ðŸ‘‰ **Problem:**  
Simulate an ATM system that allows users to withdraw money, check balance, and deposit cash.  

ðŸ’¡ **OOP Breakdown:**  
- `Account` class (balance, deposit, withdraw)  
- `ATM` class (cash dispenser, transaction handling)

### ðŸ”¹ **4. Design a Movie Ticket Booking System**  
**Concepts Used:** Classes, Objects, Encapsulation, Inheritance  

ðŸ‘‰ **Problem:**  
Users should be able to search for movies, select seats, and book tickets.  

ðŸ’¡ **OOP Breakdown:**  
- `Movie` class (title, genre, duration)  
- `Theater` class (location, available seats)  
- `Ticket` class (seat number, price)

### ðŸ”¹ **5. Design a Food Ordering System**  
**Concepts Used:** Classes, Objects, Encapsulation  

ðŸ‘‰ **Problem:**  
Customers should be able to browse menus, order food, and receive an invoice.  

ðŸ’¡ **OOP Breakdown:**  
- `FoodItem` class (name, price, category)  
- `Order` class (food items, total amount)  
- `Restaurant` class (manages orders)

### ðŸ”¹ **6. Design an Online Shopping Cart**  
**Concepts Used:** Classes, Objects, Encapsulation, Inheritance  

ðŸ‘‰ **Problem:**  
Users can add/remove items, apply discounts, and checkout.  

ðŸ’¡ **OOP Breakdown:**  
- `Product` class (name, price, category)  
- `Cart` class (list of items, total price)  
- `User` class (shopping history)
