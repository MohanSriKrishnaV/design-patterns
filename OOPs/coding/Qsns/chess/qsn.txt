### **Low-Level Design (LLD) Interview Question: Chess Game**  

ðŸ”¹ **Question:**  
Design a **Chess Game** system where two players can play against each other. Your design should include the **key classes, interactions, and constraints**.  

**Consider the following requirements:**  
1. The game is played between **two players**.  
2. Each player has **16 pieces** (King, Queen, Rook, Bishop, Knight, Pawn).  
3. The board is **8x8** with alternating colors.  
4. Players take turns making **valid moves**.  
5. The game should detect **check, checkmate, and stalemate**.  
6. Pieces should follow **specific movement rules** (e.g., Pawns move forward, Knights jump, etc.).  
7. Optional: Add support for **undo move, save game, or AI-based opponent**.  

ðŸ”¹ **Follow-up Questions:**  
- How will you represent the **board and pieces**?  
- What design pattern(s) would you use?  
- How will you ensure that only **valid moves** are allowed?  
- How would you handle **game termination conditions**?  
- How would you design the **move history and undo functionality**?  

ðŸŽ¯ **Bonus:**  
- How would you extend this design to support **online multiplayer**?  
- How would you implement an **AI opponent** using algorithms like Minimax?
