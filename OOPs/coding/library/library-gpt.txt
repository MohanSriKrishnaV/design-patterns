Absolutely! Let's break down this problem systematically and design it like an interview scenario. I'll guide you through the steps and dive deeper into each aspect of the design.

### **1. Problem Understanding and Clarification:**

The library system you need to design should allow:

1. **Users** to borrow and return books, and the system should track overdue books.
2. Different types of books: regular printed books and e-books.
3. Different types of users: regular users and premium users with extended privileges.
4. We need to use **inheritance** for shared properties and **polymorphism** for handling different types of books.

### **2. Object-Oriented Design Overview:**

Here, we are essentially modeling real-world entities: books, users, and library transactions. To manage these entities and operations efficiently, we'll use **OOP concepts** like:

- **Inheritance** to create a hierarchical relationship (e.g., base classes for books and users).
- **Polymorphism** to handle different behaviors for `EBook` and `PrintedBook`.
- **Encapsulation** to manage private states and public methods.

### **3. Class Breakdown:**

#### **Class 1: Book (Base Class)**

The `Book` class will store the common properties that all books share, such as title, author, and ISBN.

- **Attributes**:
  - `title`: Title of the book.
  - `author`: Author of the book.
  - `isbn`: Unique identifier for the book (ISBN).
  - `borrowedDate`: Date when the book was borrowed (to help track overdue status).
  - `dueDate`: Date when the book is due for return.
  - `isBorrowed`: A flag to check if the book is currently borrowed.
  
- **Methods**:
  - `borrow()`: Marks the book as borrowed.
  - `returnBook()`: Marks the book as returned.
  - `isOverdue()`: Checks if the book is overdue based on the current date.
  - `getDueDate()`: Returns the due date for the book.
  
```javascript
class Book {
  constructor(title, author, isbn) {
    this.title = title;
    this.author = author;
    this.isbn = isbn;
    this.isBorrowed = false;
    this.borrowedDate = null;
    this.dueDate = null;
  }

  borrow() {
    if (this.isBorrowed) {
      console.log(`${this.title} is already borrowed.`);
      return;
    }
    this.isBorrowed = true;
    this.borrowedDate = new Date();
    this.dueDate = new Date();
    this.dueDate.setDate(this.dueDate.getDate() + 14);  // Default loan period: 14 days
    console.log(`${this.title} borrowed successfully.`);
  }

  returnBook() {
    if (!this.isBorrowed) {
      console.log(`${this.title} is not borrowed.`);
      return;
    }
    this.isBorrowed = false;
    this.borrowedDate = null;
    this.dueDate = null;
    console.log(`${this.title} returned successfully.`);
  }

  isOverdue() {
    if (!this.isBorrowed) return false;
    const today = new Date();
    return today > this.dueDate;
  }

  getDueDate() {
    return this.dueDate;
  }
}
```

#### **Class 2: EBook (Subclass of Book)**

EBooks are a type of book but can have additional behavior like download links or format (e.g., PDF, EPUB).

- **Attributes**:
  - `downloadLink`: A URL for downloading the e-book.

- **Methods**:
  - Inherits methods from `Book` (like `borrow()`, `returnBook()`).
  - Additional methods specific to e-books can be added (e.g., `download()`).

```javascript
class EBook extends Book {
  constructor(title, author, isbn, downloadLink) {
    super(title, author, isbn);
    this.downloadLink = downloadLink;
  }

  download() {
    console.log(`Downloading e-book: ${this.title} from ${this.downloadLink}`);
  }
}
```

#### **Class 3: PrintedBook (Subclass of Book)**

PrintedBooks are physical books that can be borrowed, with behavior similar to `EBook`, but without a download link.

- **Attributes and Methods**:
  - Inherits methods from `Book`.
  - No special methods specific to printed books.
  
```javascript
class PrintedBook extends Book {
  constructor(title, author, isbn) {
    super(title, author, isbn);
  }
}
```

#### **Class 4: User (Base Class)**

The `User` class represents a person borrowing books. It has methods to borrow and return books.

- **Attributes**:
  - `name`: Name of the user.
  - `maxBooks`: Maximum number of books a user can borrow.
  - `borrowedBooks`: A list of books currently borrowed by the user.

- **Methods**:
  - `borrowBook(book)`: Allows a user to borrow a book (checking availability).
  - `returnBook(book)`: Allows a user to return a borrowed book.

```javascript
class User {
  constructor(name, maxBooks) {
    this.name = name;
    this.maxBooks = maxBooks;
    this.borrowedBooks = [];
  }

  borrowBook(book) {
    if (this.borrowedBooks.length >= this.maxBooks) {
      console.log(`${this.name} cannot borrow more books.`);
      return;
    }
    if (book.isBorrowed) {
      console.log(`${book.title} is already borrowed.`);
      return;
    }
    this.borrowedBooks.push(book);
    book.borrow();
  }

  returnBook(book) {
    const index = this.borrowedBooks.indexOf(book);
    if (index === -1) {
      console.log(`${this.name} hasn't borrowed ${book.title}.`);
      return;
    }
    this.borrowedBooks.splice(index, 1);
    book.returnBook();
  }
}
```

#### **Class 5: PremiumUser (Subclass of User)**

A `PremiumUser` can borrow more books than a regular user.

- **Attributes**:
  - Inherits from `User`, but can borrow more books.

```javascript
class PremiumUser extends User {
  constructor(name) {
    super(name, 10);  // Premium users can borrow up to 10 books
  }
}
```

#### **Class 6: Library**

The `Library` class manages a collection of books and users.

- **Attributes**:
  - `books`: A list of books in the library.
  - `users`: A list of users who can borrow books.

- **Methods**:
  - `addBook(book)`: Adds a book to the library.
  - `registerUser(user)`: Registers a new user to the library.
  - `checkOverdueBooks()`: Checks and prints overdue books.

```javascript
class Library {
  constructor() {
    this.books = [];
    this.users = [];
  }

  addBook(book) {
    this.books.push(book);
  }

  registerUser(user) {
    this.users.push(user);
  }

  checkOverdueBooks() {
    this.books.forEach(book => {
      if (book.isOverdue()) {
        console.log(`${book.title} is overdue!`);
      }
    });
  }
}
```

### **4. Example Usage:**

Let's create a library, add some books, register users, and perform some operations.

```javascript
// Creating a Library
const library = new Library();

// Adding books
const book1 = new PrintedBook('The Great Gatsby', 'F. Scott Fitzgerald', '9780743273565');
const book2 = new EBook('JavaScript: The Good Parts', 'Douglas Crockford', '9780596517748', 'https://example.com/js-book');
library.addBook(book1);
library.addBook(book2);

// Registering users
const regularUser = new User('John', 3);
const premiumUser = new PremiumUser('Alice');

// Borrowing and returning books
library.registerUser(regularUser);
library.registerUser(premiumUser);

regularUser.borrowBook(book1);
premiumUser.borrowBook(book2);

// Check overdue books
library.checkOverdueBooks();
```

### **5. Interview-Level Questions:**

1. **Design Choices:**
   - Why did you choose to use inheritance for `EBook` and `PrintedBook`?
   - What is the advantage of using polymorphism for different types of books?
   - How does encapsulation help in managing the state of each book (e.g., borrowed status, due date)?

2. **Overdue Books Handling:**
   - How would you improve the tracking of overdue books? Would you add notifications or penalties for overdue items?

3. **Extending the System:**
   - How would you extend the system to allow reserving books that are currently borrowed?
   - How would you handle the scenario where a user borrows a book but returns it late? Would you implement a penalty system?

4. **System Efficiency:**
   - How would you optimize the system if there are thousands of books and users? Would you implement a search feature for quick book lookups?

This design covers a real-world scenario and provides insight into how to model a system using OOP principles.
