# Design Patterns Learning Journey

Welcome to my **Design Patterns** learning repository! üöÄ

This repository contains my exploration and implementation of various design patterns in software development. It serves as a personal guide to understanding and applying common design patterns in real-world scenarios.

## üìö Overview

Design patterns are reusable solutions to common problems in software design. They provide a structured approach to solving problems related to object creation, structure, and behavior in a way that improves code maintainability, scalability, and readability.

In this repository, I cover both **creational**, **structural**, and **behavioral** design patterns, illustrating their use cases and benefits. Each pattern includes an explanation, example code, and real-world scenarios.

## üìñ Patterns Covered

Below is a list of the design patterns that I have studied and implemented so far:

### Creational Patterns:
- **Singleton Pattern**: Ensures a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to it.
- **Factory Method Pattern**: Defines an interface for creating objects but allows subclasses to alter the type of objects that will be created.
- **Abstract Factory Pattern**: Provides an interface for creating families of related or dependent objects without specifying their concrete classes.
- **Builder Pattern**: Separates the construction of a complex object from its representation, allowing the same construction process to create different representations.
- **Prototype Pattern**: Creates new objects by cloning an existing object, allowing for object duplication without knowing the exact class of the object.

### Structural Patterns:
- **Adapter Pattern**: Allows incompatible interfaces to work together by creating a wrapper or adapter.
- **Facade Pattern**: Provides a simplified interface to a complex system, making it easier to interact with.
- **Decorator Pattern**: Allows behavior to be added to an individual object dynamically without affecting other objects.
- **Proxy Pattern**: Provides a surrogate or placeholder for another object to control access to it.
- **Composite Pattern**: Composes objects into tree-like structures to represent part-whole hierarchies.
- **Flyweight Pattern**: Reduces memory usage by sharing common parts of the state between multiple objects.

### Behavioral Patterns:
- **Observer Pattern**: Defines a one-to-many dependency between objects, so when one object changes state, all its dependents are notified.
- **Strategy Pattern**: Defines a family of algorithms, encapsulates each one, and makes them interchangeable.
- **Command Pattern**: Encapsulates a request as an object, allowing for parameterization of clients with queues, requests, and operations.
- **State Pattern**: Allows an object to change its behavior when its internal state changes.
- **Iterator Pattern**: Provides a way to access the elements of an aggregate object sequentially without exposing its underlying representation.
- **Template Method Pattern**: Defines the skeleton of an algorithm in the superclass but lets subclasses override specific steps.
- **Mediator Pattern**: Defines an object that controls communication between different objects to reduce the dependencies between them.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies & Tools

- **Programming Languages**: JavaScript, TypeScript, Python (you can add more as needed)
- **Frameworks & Libraries**: Node.js, Angular, React (add relevant ones here)
- **Other Tools**: Git, GitHub, VS Code, etc.

## üìù How to Use

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/design-patterns-learning.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the folder for the pattern you want to explore:
   ```bash
   cd <pattern-folder>
   ```

3. Follow the README within each folder for setup instructions, if applicable. Each pattern folder contains:
   - Explanation of the pattern
   - Example code implementation
   - Use cases and practical examples

4. Feel free to experiment with the code, run examples, and try adapting the patterns to your own projects!

## üîç What You'll Learn

- The core concepts behind each design pattern.
- How to implement the patterns in different programming languages.
- Real-world use cases and when to apply each pattern.
- How design patterns can make your code more efficient, maintainable, and scalable.
